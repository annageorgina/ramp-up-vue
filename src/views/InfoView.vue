        <h2>Improvements</h2>
        <p> Feature to remove specific employee from workspace </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When an employee is edited the same employee is still in the unedited info inside workspaces ! </p>
        <p>When an employee is deleted they can still be part of a workspace!</p>
        <p>A solution for this would be to use UUID instead ! </p>
        <p>All the style and "prettyiness" is missing ...  </p>
